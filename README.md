# 8ResQ
An android application targeted for personal care and hospital management during COVID.

Perosna:
1. Medical professional perspective:
I am Alex, working as a medical professional in a major hospital. With pandemic in place I should try to protect myself by reducing the number of interactions with other people in hospital. I'm looking for an application that can provide a way to request a resource( which can be masks/ oxygen cylinders or food/medication for patients). Application has to assign a default priority to the request placed. I can edit/delete the resource requests that I generate. It should provide sign functionality to avoid misuse/flooding the application with spam requests. 

2. Hospital Administrator perspective:
I am David, working as hospital administrator. I am looking to reduce human to human interactions for resource allocation/requests. I feel that a mobile application with this functionality would highly help me from work front. Application should provide different functionality for user and admin personal. It has to provide a way to group/filter out requests based on the category type(Medication, Covid Kits, Food etc). I should be able to edit/delete a particular resource request and also be able to make changes to priority assigned to resource request. It has to provide sign-in functionality to reduce/avoid spam requests. Should provide a way to add users to authorized list of users who can request for resources. When the resources are provided/unavailable I should be able to mark the resource request as complete. I should be able to comment on the resource requests.
